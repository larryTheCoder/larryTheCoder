## Hello there :)

As you might know, I am larryTheCoder, He/him, 17 years old dude who works on **Minecraft Pocket Edition plugins** mostly.
I am mostly active in Java programming rather than PHP, so I am used with Java programming, concurrency, and
mostly multi-threaded alike operations. 

I am still a student and will always be, I am also experienced in developing an Arduino project for my school, and it got
on the 3rd place in the competition! Currently I am working on ASkyBlock and PotatoBot, _my discord bot code that is written in
java_.

### How to reach me?
Feel free to contact me thru discord! My discord tag is MrPotato101#0060 or just get into PMMP discord guild and message me
from there.

_Also I learn how to code by myself._
