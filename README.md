Well like you know, this is an internet, everyone knows who you really are, so it is quite useless to have this thing removed so let them see it themselves lol.

As you might know, I am larryTheCoder, He/him, 17 years old dude who works on **Minecraft Pocket Edition plugins** mostly.
I am mostly active in Java programming rather than PHP, so I am used with Java programming, concurrency, and
mostly multi-threaded alike operations. 

I am still a student and will always be, I am also experienced in developing an Arduino project for my school, and it got
on the 3rd place in the competition! Currently I am working on ASkyBlock and PotatoBot, _my discord bot code that is written in
java_.

_Also I learn how to code by myself._
